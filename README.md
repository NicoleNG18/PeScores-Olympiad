PE Scores
This is my project for NITO 2024

Overview:
Spring MVC Web application, Thymeleaf for front-end, MY SQL server for the database.
PE Scores is a web application for PE teachers. It helps them to calculate students' grades by norms and manage their other work tasks.

Functionalities:
Firstly, users have to register and log in.

After that they have to add your classes as well with students in them

And then they only have to enter students' results and see the average grade.

Conclusion:
The app is still in development. If you have any ideas for improvement, please DM me.
